Welcome to the UVic ATLAS tutorial on analysis preservation with RECAST! RECAST combines docker and gitlab to fully preserve your ATLAS search analysis so that it can be trivially re-interpreted with a new signal model.

<b>Credits:</b> The docker intro in this tutorial is adapted from a [more extended docker tutorial](https://matthewfeickert.github.io/intro-to-docker/) given at the [first US-ATLAS computing bootcamp](https://smeehan12.github.io/2019-08-19-usatlas-computing-bootcamp/) held at LBNL in August 2019.
