title: "Skimming and Reformatting Steps for RECASTing the VHbb Analysis"
teaching: 10
exercises: 40
questions:
- "How do I use the yadage syntax I've learned to preserve the analysis steps needed to prepare my signal for interpretation?"
objectives:
- "Practice using yadage syntax to describe the first two steps of our VHbb analysis."
- "Add a new executable to your analysis framework to convert the ROOT histograms created by Analysis payload to a simple text file format."
keypoints:
- "The yadage syntax for defining our analysis steps is not too different from our helloworld example."
- "The main things that change are the details of the script processes and the docker image to run."

## Introduction

We now have all the yadage tools to put together our VHbb RECAST workflow, starting by "yadage-ifying" our first two analysis steps using the syntax we just learned. We can use essentially the same yadage structure and syntax for defining our analysis steps as we did for the message writing and shouting steps. 

### Skimming Step

<img src="../fig/SkimmingStep.png" alt="Skimming" style="width:220px">

On gitlab, create a new repo to contain your workflow. Name it something like `danika-workflow` (but with your name instead of mine). Clone your new repo onto your computer.


**In another shell**, cd into the workflow repo and start the yadage container so you can validate and test the steps and workflow as you develop. You'll also need to log in to the gitlab docker registry using your CERN credentials so yadage can automatically pull images from the gitlab registry:

~~~
cd [your workflow repo]
docker run --rm -it -e PACKTIVITY_WITHIN_DOCKER=true -v $PWD:$PWD -w $PWD -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock yadage/yadage sh
docker login gitlab-registry.cern.ch
~~~
{: .source}

cd into your new workflow repo, and create your empty steps.yml and workflow.yml files. Next, create a directory called `inputdata`, copy your signal DAOD file into `inputdata`, and rename it `recast_daod.root`:

~~~
cd /path/to/new/workflow/repo
touch steps.yml
touch workflow.yml
mkdir inputdata
cp /path/to/DAOD_EXOT27.17882744._000026.pool.root.1 inputdata/recast_daod.root
~~~
{: .source}

> ## Providing files to yadage
> Since we have a signal DAOD file for yadage to process, we'll need a way to tell the yadage-run command where to look for the DOAD file. This functionality is provided by the `-d initdir=` option. For example, if the file to input is named `inputfile.txt`, and it's located in the directory `inputdata` syntax for passing it to yadage-run as the variable inputfile would be:
> 
> ~~~
> yadage-run workdir workflow.yml -p inputfile=inputfile.txt -d initdir=$PWD/inputdata

### Reformatting Step

<img src="../fig/ReformattingStep.png" alt="Reformatting" style="width:230px">

In this step, we read in the dijet invariant mass histogram `h_mjj_kin_cal` that was written out to a ROOT file in the last step, and write it out to a text file so it can be easily read in by the final interpretation step. The required format of the output text file is space-separated histogram bin edges in the first row and space-separated bin contents in the second row. For a five-bin triangle-shaped histogram with bin edges ranging from 0 to 8, for example, the contents would be:

~~~
0.0 2.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 8.0
0.0 1.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 
~~~

You can try setting up the container for this step yourself in the following exercise.

> ## Exercise (25 min)
> 
> Create an executable named `ReformatHist` that takes the ROOT histogram produced by `AnalysisPayload`, and converts it to a text file containing the `h_mjj_kin_cal` histogram in the format described just above this exercise. The command to run the finished executable will be:
>
> ~~~
> ReformatHist /path/to/output/hist.root /path/to/output/textfile.txt
> ~~~ 
> 
> #### Part 1
> In your git repo, create a new file named ReformatHist.cxx in the AnalysisPayload/utils directory. 
>
> ~~~
> cd AnalysisPayload/utils
> touch ReformatHist.cxx
> ~~~
> {: .source}
> cd up the main repo and, if you haven't already, run a container from the `atlas/analysisbase:21.2.85-centos7` image, volume-mounting the whole analysis repo into the container.
>
> ~~~
> cd ../..
> docker run --rm -it -w /home/atlas/Bootcamp -v \
> $PWD:/home/atlas/Bootcamp atlas/analysisbase:21.2.85-centos7 \
> bash -c 'cp -r ssh-credentials ~/.ssh; cp gitconfig ~/.gitconfig ; bash'
> ~~~
> {: .source}
> 
> #### Part 2
> Now, add a **new executable** to your CMakeLists.txt file in AnalysisPayload named `ReformatHist` that will run the code. Consider which libraries will actually need to be linked, and which ones can be safely omitted for this executable. 
> 
> #### Part 3
> Fill in ReformatHist.cxx so the corresponding ReformatHist executable can accomplish the task described in the beginning of the exercise. You can compile and test the code in the container as you work. Start with the following skeleton:

> ## Bonus Exercise!
> The task we accomplished above in pure ROOT could also be accomplished with a fair bit less coding by making use of python's uproot or rootpy+root_numpy packages. Since the amount of data encoded in the histograms is very small compared with the original DAOD, any speed losses we may suffer in going from pure ROOT code to python for this step are essentially negligible. As such, this is a situation in which it may well be to our benefit to take advantage of high level python modules. The main downside in our particular case is that `atlas/analysisbase:21.2.85-centos7` doesn't have a ROOT installation with python bindings (needed for rootpy+root_numpy) or python 3.6 (needed for uproot), so it's best to build or own docker images for this task. 
> 
> we provide "starter" repos for . You can choose to work with one of them depending on your desired implementation. 
>
> Each repo includes:
> * a Dockerfile which specifies the base image and installs any required dependencies (feel free to add more dependencies if you need to!), 
> * a source code file to start with that includes/imports the libraries/modules that you're likely to need (feel free to add more if needed!), and some guiding comments.
> 
> ### Starter repos
> 
> * **uproot ([link to gitlab repo](https://gitlab.cern.ch/damacdon/uproot)):** The Dockerfile starts from the official python:3.6 base image, and installs the uproot python module on top of it. The [uproot.open function](https://uproot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/opening-files.html#uproot-open) can convert the ROOT file into a "ROOTDirectory" object, from which the `h_mjj_kin_cal` can be read and converted to a numpy array with the `numpy()` function, [as described in the github README](https://github.com/scikit-hep/uproot#histograms-tprofiles-tgraphs-and-others).
>
> * **rootpy_numpy ([link to gitlab repo](https://gitlab.cern.ch/damacdon/rootpy_numpy)):** The Dockerfile starts from a centos7 image with ROOT (+python2.7 bindings) pre-installed, and   installs the rootpy and root_numpy python modules on top of it. rootpy's [root_open](http://www.rootpy.org/reference/generated/rootpy.io.root_open.html) function can be used to read in the `h_mjj_kin_cal` histogram from the ROOT file (this part is already filled in since the online documentation isn't very thorough), and root_numpy's [hist2array](http://scikit-hep.org/root_numpy/reference/generated/root_numpy.hist2array.html) function can be used to convert the ROOT histogram to a numpy array.

Now that we've got our environment and executable set up, we can encode this second step in yadage and add it to the steps.yml file:

~~~
reformatting_step:
  process:
    process_type: interpolated-script-cmd
    script: |
      source ~/release_setup.sh		# NOTE: This command shouldn't be needed if you're using an image you produced in the bonus "python-implementation" exercise!
      source /Bootcamp/build/x86_64-centos7-gcc8-opt/setup.sh
      cd /Bootcamp/run
      ReformatHist {hist_root} {hist_txt}     # Change the exact run command if your executable has a different name or location
  publisher:
    publisher_type: interpolated-pub
    publish:
      hist_txt: '{hist_txt}'
  environment:
    environment_type: docker-encapsulated
    image: [gitlab registry image for your analysis repo]
    imagetag: master       
~~~
{: .source}

along with the corresponding workflow.yml stage:

~~~
- name: reformatting_step
  dependencies: [skimming_step]
  scheduler:
    scheduler_type: singlestep-stage
    parameters:
      hist_root: {step: skimming_step, output: selected_events}
      hist_txt: '{workdir}/selected.txt'
    step: {$ref: steps.yml#/reformatting_step}
~~~
{: .source}

> ## Exercise (5 min)
> Put together and run a `packtivity-run` command to test the reformatting step.
> 
> > ## Solution
> > ~~~
> > packtivity-run steps.yml#/reformatting_step -p hist_root="'{workdir}/workdir/skimming_step/selected.root'" -p hist_txt="'{workdir}/selected.txt'"
> > ~~~
> > {: .source}
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

The `yadage-run` command to test the updated workflow should be the same as before, since we haven't added any more initial files or parameters:

~~~
yadage-run workdir workflow.yml -p signal_daod=recast_daod.root -d initdir=$PWD/inputdata
~~~
